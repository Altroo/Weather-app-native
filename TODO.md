# Project Overview
## React Native Weather App

Build a simple mobile weather application using React Native that fetches and displays weather data from a public API.

## Technical Requirements

    •Develop using React Native (Expo or bare workflow is acceptable)
    •Create a clean and intuitive user interface suitable for mobile devices
    •Integrate with OpenWeatherMap or a similar public, no-auth weather API
    •Handle API fetching, loading states, and potential errors gracefully
    •Manage application state effectively (e.g., using useState, useReducer, or a state management library)

## Required Features

    •Current weather display (temperature, conditions, icon)
    •Basic forecast display (e.g., next few hours or days)
    •Ability to search for weather by city name
    •Display loading indicators while fetching data
    •Show user-friendly error messages on API failure

## Evaluation Criteria

    •Code organization and component structure in React Native
    •UI/UX implementation quality on mobile
    •Correct implementation of API integration and data handling
    •State management approach and effectiveness
    •Handling of loading states and errors
    •Cross-platform considerations and native component usage

## Deliverables

    •GitHub repository containing complete React Native source code
    •README with setup instructions (including API key guidance if needed) and notes on implementation decisions
    •Brief explanation of where AI tools were used (if applicable)
    •Optionally, screenshots or a short video of the app running

## Time Limit
There is no time limit for this project, but it is recommended to complete it within a few hours.
